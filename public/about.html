<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am passionate about learning new skills, never staying at the same point. 
  This often takes me out of my comfort zone and I end up trying to catch-up with what is happening around but I also believe that it is also how I learn best. 
  Jump head first into deep water and figgure it out afterwards.</p>

<p>I am a proud mother of two kids, who constantly teach me new things. To begin with - how to make mistakes, own them and learn from them.</p>

<p>At different stages of my life, I have had differen goals and have set different objectives ahead of me.
  However, they all have had one thing in common and that is - people. I always knew I want to stay connected, insipired, learn from and coach others, no matter what I do in life.
